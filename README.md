- 👋 Hi there, I’m @freetoexplore, an post-business consultant and pre-technical engineer.
- 👀 I’m interested in data exploration, automation, machine learning and real-time visualization.

- 💞️ I’m looking forward to design an interactive and user-friendly product. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... Gently drop an email to yidangao0129@outlook.com by introducing yourself with reaching purpose.

In this repo, you'll find some warm up practices. Hope you will enjoy the cracking moment as it shall 'turn anguish into flowers'.

- Basic Concepts

After working for a while, I've been consistently looking for what remains unchanged in daily trivial and the derived magnificent goals. 
One thing comes up in my mind is the principles, of which lead people behave with righteousness and rationales.
It is genuinely comprehensive and practical key for the wider public to open the door of modern wisdom, 
which keeps simplicity, essence, and elegance (sophisticated: precise, cost-saving: margins/granularity, humanity: user-friendly) in mind.

I am always shocked on the gap of how I have believed human are capable of doing and how things/lives are limited of, like any language itself. 
It is the longing for a lasting and stable foundation that leads me to dictionaries and manuals. By understanding the base rules, it creates solid and resilient commitment and ultimately saves more.

当我在尝试为这个长期的，注定会诞生的产品构想时，对选词我尤为注意。我想这部分不仅是一个基础概念，它像一座桥，可不是桥本身；像一座建筑，但更灵活；像生命初始的状态，却并不意味着溯源。
